# VoatConspiracy
A github project for management of documents relating to voat.co/v/conspiracy

### Open source moderation! (sort of)

Anyone may propose a change to any subverse configuration, rules, or moderation policy. Hosting the documents for these things on github makes it easier than ever for regular users to help shape their community.

To suggest a change, one option is to make a pull request. To make a pull request, the easiest way is to:

  * Click on the filename in the list above
  * Then click the little pencil icon labelled "edit this file"
  * Make whatever changes you think appropriate
  * [Optional] write a brief description of the changes you made in the little box at the bottom
  * click the green "propose file change" button 
  * click the green "create pull request" button

Alternatively, you can share your proposal on /v/conspiracy, /v/conspiracymeta, /v/ideasforconspiracy, or via private message to any /v/conspiracy moderator, like @Mumberthrax.
