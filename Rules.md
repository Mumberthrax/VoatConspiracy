### /v/Conspiracy Rules

This document contains the rules for https://voat.co/v/Conspiracy

---

Rule 1: No Spam or Memes
  * This includes advice-animals or demotivational style images/macros
  * Posting content is great, but make sure you aren't flooding the queue and sliding others' posts into obscurity by posting too frequently. Give people time to view, vote, and comment, if that's their preference.

Rule 2: No bigotry or hate speech
  * This includes, but is not limited to, bigotry based upon ethnicity, age, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, and religion.

Rule 3: No harassment, flaming, or excessive trolling
  * We're here to chat about conspiracies - about ideas - not to get into petty insult-slinging matches over the internet.
  * This sort of stuff only harms our community, and discourages people from participating in the discussion.
  * It's possible to harass someone even if you have good intentions - like if you're following someone you think is disruptive or a propagandist around and posting annoying things in response to their posts/comments. Maybe they deserve it, maybe not. Better to let a moderator know than stoop to that level and run the risk of scaring onlookers away from participating.

Rule 4: No accusing others of being shills
  * Yes we know astroturfing is real, and we know *some* of those people probably *are* shills, and we need to be vigilant about their disruption. It still doesn't contribute anything to our community to call them as such in public.
  * Focus on behaviors. If someone is exhibiting a pattern of disruption, let a moderator know or post about it on /v/conspiracymeta.
