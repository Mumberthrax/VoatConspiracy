# Moderation Policy

### Mission

Our mission is to provide a place to discuss conspiracy theories without bigotry or marginalizing, with a high signal to noise ratio.  
We value open-mindedness, critical thought/cogency (always seek quality sources!), and courtesy.

Moderators are public servants, here to support the community in this mission.

### Responsibilities and Guidelines

##### Basics/miscellaneous

* Remove stuff that violates the rules

* Promote community guidelines that help everyone to get along better.

* Always distinguish comments when acting in an official capacity. Keep personal opinions about politics out of anything to do with moderation - unless it already specifically relates to moderation-related issues.

##### Respect the community

* Maintain a level of professionalism and courtesy when acting as a mod. Treat everyone with respect, even rule breakers or assholes.

* Generally err on the side of admonition and reform rather than removal. People make mistakes. Better to have people who previously erred in the community than a bunch of folks walking on eggshells.

* Generally warn users first before banning

* When someone is banned, permit a ban appeal process in meta subverse

##### Communication

* Try to be transparent with everything relating to moderation.

* Listen to the community, and communicate. Community should know who to go to when they have questions, and if you don't know the answers talk with the mod team and find out.

* When users report something, take it seriously and respond as soon as possible - and follow up, even if you have no new information, just to let them know what's going on.

##### Be active

* Maintain a reasonable level of activity on the subverse - two weeks without any kind of interaction and the mod is liable to get a ping.

* Generally be active and on top of disruption/attacks as they occur.

##### Don'ts

* Everyone makes mistakes - including moderators. It's ok. Admit it as soon as possible. If you're late admitting it, don't keep it a secret just go ahead and admit it anyway. Accept it and work on improving.

* Don't make any project or thing claiming to represent the community at large without first discussing it with the community. (e.g. podcasts or newsletters or something)

##### Work to support three agendas:

> * Help the community to more effectively organize and process the torrent of information about conspiracies and deep politics in informative and useful ways.

> * Help to strengthen the community against disruptive elements, such as trolling, flaming, astroturfing, disinformation, misinformation, etc.

> * Help to encourage active participation, leadership, and community bonds.

Facilitate, promote, and create/manage projects which support these three goals.  

Some examples: AMA's, Stickying regular discussion topics chosen by the community, promoting links that help educate about disruptive behaviors and how to identify false or unsubstantiated information, promote community guidelines, movie/book nights/discussions, helping non-moderators to manage some aspects of these projects, etc.

### Adding new mods:

Much of this section is pending more in-depth community discussion.

##### Challenges:

* **Entryism** - infiltration by malicious individuals/groups
* **Incompetence** - some moderators may simply not have a clue (this can often be remedied with training, but not always)
* **Inactivity** - disinterest in helping the community
* **Immaturity** - unprofessional behavior

##### Options:

* **Sortition** - active community members are added to a drawing, randomly selected at intervals and invited to become moderators. Given training, closely monitored through logs, and voted out by community if misconduct occurs. Set term limits.

* **Meritocracy** - Moderators select active, seemingly mature/responsible people to be moderators, and keep a close watch for misconduct. Confirmation by the community ("do you hate this person's guts? if so then we'll pick someone else").

* **Popular Vote** - the details would need to be heavily scrutinized otherwise it risks entryism and infiltration by malicious elements, or incompetence. Also vote manipulation. Probably would use the alternative vote instead of first past the post. Or do some kind of crazy randomly-selected-voter survey setup...

* **Unnamed method** - Mod team selects candidates, community has a popular vote on them. Candidates serve set period of time, then are removed. No consecutive terms.
    * This might be better for a sort of "administrative" group of moderators, if we add many mods for routine cleanup stuff. Such mods would be primarily responsible for taking a leading role in the development of the subverse, its look and feel, beyond just cleaning up rule-breaking stuff.

* **Authoritarian discretion** - The "level 1" moderator picks whoever they want, removes them on a whim.

##### Principles:

* People with names designed to start fights (like 'nigger', 'ConspiraciesAreFake', and 'shill') should not be allowed to be mods.

* Only accounts older than 90(?) days should be allowed to be mods, so their behavior and history can be reviewed

* There should probably be a ratio of moderators to active users or posts, at least as a baseline, to ensure effective moderation (what ratio? how will this be measured?)

* After being added, a brief training period should occur, and a review period (how long?) to make sure the mod knows how to handle various situations and actually is interested in helping as a moderator.

### Removing mods:

If a mod is deemed by the community to be acting improperly, the community may create a review post on /r/conspiracymeta and collect evidence or statements. If the "level 1" moderator disagrees with the motion to remove the mod and the community insists, then a neutral third party should be invited by the mod team to mediate if it is serious. Generally err on the side of admonition and reform rather than removal. People make mistakes.

If a mod is completely inactive for two weeks or so, they should be messaged by another mod. Two months with no response and they're liable to be removed. If they return, and the community has no objections, they can be re-modded without any fuss.

Moderators should probably have term limits. Detials on how such limits would work are pending a more in-depth community discussion. For now, there are no limits.

### Changes to rules, policies:

* Generally these should be either run by the community first to get a sense of where they stand, or implemented and feedback sought after a reasonable interval (1 week to a month maybe). If the community truly hates it after giving whatever it is a reasonable try, then change it.

* Listen to feedback and try to incorporate sensible suggestions for improvement.

* Periodically solicit feedback from users on how the subverse can be improved.

* Review any pull requests or suggestions made periodically as a mod team, and as a community. Any that are particularly interesting or novel should probably get extra attention.

* Consider incorporating polls - keep them short and simple, concise and clear.

* Communicate. Whenever ANY changes happen, keep the community informed.

### Transparency, accountability:

* Users should not be punished for sharing conversations they've had with moderators acting in an official capacity. However, moderators should not publicly share conversations containing confidential or sensitive information shared with them - everyone should feel free to speak candidly with moderators without fear of mob punishment for doing so.

* Links to moderation logs should be available.

* Any major changes should be highly visibly documented, at the very least on /v/conspiracymeta

* Community members should periodically review/monitor moderation logs for any potential mod misconduct, and bring it to the attention of the level-1 mod, and the community.

* There is a balance to be struck between expediency and transparency. We’re not here to play government, we’re here to provide a service. If we get bogged down in endless discussion, or need to present everything we do to public review *before* following through we may not get much done at all. That being said, it is important that we involve the general community in the running of the subverse as ultimately everything we do is for them.

### Rule #0

Atko is always right, and the level 1 mod can overrule any subverse policy in the interest of common sense and a functional subverse.

Rule Zero is simply a reminder that the admin and top moderator have to exercise some common sense and are permitted to supersede the rules when the rules would ruin enjoyment and fair play. While a level 1 mod has fiat to exercise Rule Zero at will, they are reminded that excessive arbitrary use of this rule will eventually lead to an empty subverse.
